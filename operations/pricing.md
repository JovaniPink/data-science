## FOOD & BEVERAGE FRAMING REVENUE

## CALCULATIONS:

### Understanding a Cover

A cover could also be looked at like as a dollar amount of guest expenditure. Using covers as a basis for predicting sales revenue enables a restaurant to base projections on the entire range of what a typical customer orders rather than simply on the entree.

Thinking in terms of covers is useful when planning front of the house staffing. It takes more servers and busboys as well as more of the hostess's attention to handle a larger number of covers than a larger number of menu items. One guest ordering 10 items, from a staffing point, is logistically easier than 10 guests ordering 10 items. So, we will now use covers to determine not just forecasted sales but also forecasted cost.
Previously we mentioned that a cover could be a placeholder for a dollar amount - Basically years of sales data or new restaurant start up would have a monetary amount for each person to spend to generate revenue. We currently use past sales data to come up with a forecasted amount for each cover. For SB 2018 $18.58 is our target.
That $18.58 is some sort of balance between recovering cost and turning a profit. A certain percentage of that dollar is cost, but the cost could be broken down into further sub categories, being: labor cost, food cost, beer cost, wine cost, and controllable.

### Throughput Target

Simply put, throughput is a 'sales-building' concept measured by sales per hour.

Many people think they are maximizing sales when there's a standing line at the front door. But I've often gone into restaurants where there's a waiting line, but there are 12 empty tables in the restaurant. What many restaurateurs don't realize is that without putting measurements or standards in place to track every component of the dining experience, there's no way to increase efficiency and find ways to bring in the highest sales.
Calculating throughput target
The equation for the throughput target is: Throughput Target = Seating Capacity x Seating Efficiency (how fast we could seat and turntables) x Table Turn Times (how long the tables sit) x Per Person Average (\$ per cover).

### Break-Even Point

This number lets you pinpoint how much you must do in sales to earn back an investment.

Your break-even point is one of the first numbers you should calculate. The number can then be used to forecast how long it will take to earn that money back.
You can also use break-even to justify a new big purchase, like a commercial kitchen redesign or launching a new marketing campaign. Saying something will cost $20,000 is one thing but saying it will pay for itself in 3 months is a better way to put that number in perspective. 
Calculating Break-Even Point:
If your restaurant does $10,000 in sales one month, pays $3,000 in variable costs, and $4,000 in fixed costs, you break-even point in dollars is $5,714.29 for that month, meaning that you start earning profit after selling $5,714.29 worth of food & drink.
The equation for breakeven point is: Total Fixed Costs ÷ ((Total Sales - Total Variable Costs) / Total Sales) = Break Even Point
In this scenario, $10,000 - $3,000 (sales minus variable cost) equals $7,000. $7,000 / $10,000 = 0.7, and $4,000 (fixed costs) divided by 0.7 gives you \$5,714.29.

### Cost of Sales (COGS)

Cost of sales tracks the amount of money you spend on food and beverages supplied to your customers.

Using the example of the one cover at a sale of 18.58. A percentage of that sale includes a cost of goods to make the sale happen. At the sandbar we have five categories, food, liquor, wine, beer, and controllable... Not all guest order from all five categories. But from past data and forecasted numbers we come up with an ideal percentage we want to hit in each category for each sale. What important factors of operations should we be concerned with, spends true on inventory, menu pricing, portion control” ... Beginning Inventory + Purchased Inventory – Ending Inventory =

Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)

Calculating Food Cost Percentage

If it costs $3.28 to prepare your salmon dish and you sell it for $15, your food cost percentage would be 21.9%. Although it depends on the novelty aspects of your dish, your guests’ expectations, and your restaurant’s service type. You can calculate your food cost percentage for all goods sold by dividing your total food costs by your total sales during a set time. If you understand your food cost percentage for each of your menu items, you can choose to upsell or design your menu to promote the items that contribute the most to your revenue and bottom line.
The equation for food cost percentage is:

Food Cost / Total Sales = Food Cost Percentage aka the cost of food contrasting our total sales.

### Labor Cost

We must also account for the labor involved in the prep of food and beverages.

Labor cost would also be a percentage of that cover's sale. Salaries and hourly wages for all employees from your head chefs to your bussers make up your restaurant labor cost. Another addition to labor cost is full-timers benefits; for everyone dollar of labor cost we add another 35 cents for benefits.

Calculating the Cost of Labor:

Total amount of hours divided by the total amount of covers.
Wages dollars divided by the total amount of sales.
The equation for the labor cost (hours per volume) is:
Hours / Cover Volume = Hours per Volume
The equation for the Wages as a percent of sales is:
Wages / Total Sales = W%S (Wages as a Percent of Sales)

### Prime Cost

A restaurant’s prime cost is the sum of all its labor costs (salaried, hourly, benefits, etc.) and its COGS.

Typically, a restaurants prime cost makes up about 60% of its total sales. Prime cost is an important metric because it represents the bulk of a restaurant’s controllable expenses. While you can't control fixed rent costs on a weekly or monthly basis, for instance, you can find ways to decrease prime costs by managing labor carefully, ordering carefully. Thus, a restaurant’s prime costs represent the primary area a restaurant owner can optimize to decrease costs and increase profit.
Calculating Prime Cost
Now that you know how to calculate COGS, calculating prime cost is straightforward. Add up all your various labor-related costs. These costs include salaried labor, hourly wages, payroll tax, and benefits. Then, simply add the sum of your labor costs and your COGS to find your restaurant’s prime cost.
The equation for prime cost is:
Labor + COGS = Prime Cost

## ADDING TIME:

How do we break up time? To be on the same page we would consider of daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and yearly numbers. But what numbers? Numbers being dollars, percentage variances, and labor times - all these numbers are using the same mathematical numerals, but each are of their own type. Type meaning that only a set of meaning and operations could be applied to each. It's an interesting study in category theory... Budgeting and forecasting... But also taking in the actual (real business numbers).

### Variance Analysis

The process of analyzing and explaining differences between actual figures and forecast or budgeted figures.

More broadly, the analysis of differences between any two or more sets of related figures. Also known as 'comparative analysis'.
Variance B/(W) and Metric Variance B/(W) are Variance analysis and B/(W) standing for Better/(Worse). Under the B/(W) convention, good news is denoted by a POSITIVE number or highlighted GREEN.
Good news is also known as a 'favorable variance'. For example, a cost saving or an income improvement. A common example is a better actual result, compared with an earlier forecast.
Under the B/(W) convention a NEGATIVE number or highlighted RED are bad news, 'worse'.
Bad news is also known as an 'adverse' variance with a result of missing a forecast.
Both cases they are just numbers and do not give the complete story of the business.

Cost of Sales Metric Variance B/(W)

Forecast Cost % - Actual Cost % = Cost % Metric Var B/(W)
Cost of Sales Variance B/(W)

AKA Price Variance

Cost % Metric Var B/(W) \* Actual Sales $ = Cost $ Var B/(W)
(F, L, B, W, C) per Volume Metric Variance B/(W)

Forecast *PV - Actual *PV = _PV Metric Var B/(W) --- Where _ stands for any of our cost categories: Food, Liquor, Wine, Beer, Controllable.
(F, L, B, W, C) per Volume Variance B/(W)

_PV Metric Var B/(W) _ Actual Volume = Cost \$ Var B/(W)
(F, L, B, W, C) as a Percent of Sales Metric Variance B/(W)

Forecast _%S – Actual _%S = \*%S Metric Variance B/(W)
(F, L, B, W, C) as a Percent of Sales Variance B/(W)

_%S Metric Var B/(W) _ Actual Sales \$ = \* Var B/(W)
Hours per Volume Metric Variance B/(W)

Forecast HPV – Actual HPV = HPV Metric Var B/(W)
Hours per Volume Variance B/(W)

HPV Metric Var B/(W) \* Actual Volume = Wages \$ Var B/(W)
Wages as a Percent of Sales Metric Variance B/(W)

Forecast W%S - Actual W%S = W%S Metric Var B/(W)
Wages as a Percent of Sales Variance B/(W)

W%S Metric Var B/(W) \* Actual Sales $ = Wages $ Var B/(W)

## ADD:

1. Monitor Inventory Closely:
   If you look closely at the cost of goods sold equation, you won’t see the term "sold" in the entire line. This is because COGS can exist independent of sales, funnily enough.
   How? Through poor inventory management. Restaurants that don't have closely-monitored back-of-house guidelines can lose money every single shift due to inventory spillage. Improper portioning, over ordering, waste, and theft can take a big chunk out of your restaurant's COGS without adding a penny to your bottom line.
   Make sure you have a reliable restaurant inventory management system in place to closely monitor the ins and outs of your restaurant inventory. Otherwise, your COGS will be much lower than it needs to be, and your wallet will be emptier than you'd want it to be.
   All things considered, this is probably the best way to lower your restaurant cost of goods sold. This method lets you keep the quality of your food high, simplify your kitchen, and plug the money drains in your back of house.
2. Forecast Accurately
   Forecasting:
   But let us put that aside and bring in another concept of forecasting the amount of covers.
3. Reflect and iterate honestly

We have been working in a 2d plane, but reality and modeling reality is more complex and are we are now able to handle more complexity do to the computational tools that have come out lately... Big Data, Machine & Deep Learning, and artificial intelligence.
We have also just been dealing with numbers and data we predict and accrual... But we have access to other numbers and data external our own financial system. Take the weather, traffic patterns, airport incoming and outgoing ... Or our own hotel bookings. These different data sources allow us to gain a greater abstracted view of the business and driving factors. And thanks to data science and its tools we can model not only 2d data sets but multiple 2d data sets on top of each other and run training models with the latest machine learning algorithms. We already behave been doing statistics but now we are doing advance computational stats with computer support.
