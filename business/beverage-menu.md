\*sudachi shochu Tasting Notes: Made using the juice of the Sudachi citrus, which is a Tokushima specialty popular nationwide. Sudachi Shochu retains some of this bitterness, acidity, and a sweet citrusy aroma. Great in cocktails, on the rocks, with water or club soda, and in cocktails.

\*Yuzu is a sour Japanese citrus fruit, used both for its juice and its aromatic rind. The yuzu (which is about the size of a tangerine) has an aroma and flavor that is distinct from any other citrus fruit, somewhat akin to a cross between grapefruit and lime.

\*Maestro Dobel Humito (Smoked Tequila) Color - Bright, clear liquid with touches of silver and exceptional body that comes from high-quality agave used to make the tequila. Aroma - Aroma notably smoky and complex, with forward notes of encino and mesquite wood and fruity floral tones. Perfectly balanced sensations of buttery caramel, cooked agave, olive and dried fruit. Taste - A delicate and satisfying bouquet of sweet caramel flavors with maple and honey top notes, layered with the essence of fresh cut mesquite wood. The finish is long on the palate with hints of roast nuts and vanilla.
