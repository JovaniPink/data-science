# Culture

## Our purpose:

To create and pair great quality cocktails within our pan Asian theme and whiskey bar.

## My vision:

So I need to establish my vision which is 100% guest satisfaction and the value and behavior that will make it happen.... why is this important?

What does the best guest experience looks like, what does it feel like, what does it smell like, what does it taste like; when you go to a nice restaurant or have an awesome experience what do you enjoy about it? What leaves you wanting to come back? Is it the theme, the ambience, etc. I want you to think about it because this will drive our vision 2020 menu, and marketing.

## Our mission:

Ask you! How do you think we get to the vision? How do we get 100% guest satisfaction?

## To the team:

I am committed to providing the tools, knowledge, stable work environment with fair and transparent coaching for your learning and personal growth.

Creativity whether innovation or reimagining are encouraged for improving the effectiveness of the Morimoto Asia Bar.

Above all, I want to promote a fun and healthy work environment where we the team will be providing the same concern, respect, and caring attitude within ourselves, barracks, and servers that they are expected to share externally with every Patron.
