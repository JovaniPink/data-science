# Whiskey Basics

The whiskeys covered in this deck are produced either in the United States or Canada. Various grains: rye, wheat, corn, malted barley and oats mixed together produce the mash bill to create the numerous whiskey options. The legal requirements for production vary by the types of grains, the percent or proof of alcohol and the length, plus manner of their aging. Regulations vary above and below the Canadian border, the most popular are below…

## AMERICAN Styles:

A. Bourbon Whiskey is a type of American whiskey, a barrel-aged distilled spirit made primarily from corn.
The top 3 Federal Standards of Identity for Distilled Spirits state that bourbon made in U.S. must be:
Be made of a grain mixture that is at least 51% corn.
Must be distilled to no more than 160 (U.S.) proof (80% alcohol by volume).
Aged in new, charred oak barrels.

B. Straight Bourbon is the label specifically given to bourbons, ryes, wheat, malts, and Tennessee whiskeys, they must have a mash bill consisting of at least 51% of their particular grain, be distilled no more than 80% ABV (160 proof) and be aged for at least two years in new charred oak barrels. Tennessee’s number one difference is that most of them perform a process that filters their whiskey through sugar maple charcoal, unique to their state. Also bourbon can’t contain any added flavors or coloring.

C. Blended American Whiskey is required to contain at least 20% straight whiskey. Blended whiskey that contains the minimum of 51% straight whiskey of a particular grain can legally use that grain in its label description – for example, blended bourbon or blended rye. Most often recommended when guest asks for whiskey and coke.

D. Corn Whiskeys must contain 80% or more corn and be distilled at no more than 80% ABV (160 proof).

## II. CANADIAN Styles:

A. Canadian Whiskey have less regulation to remember, there whiskey and rye whiskey is almost interchangeable. No legal
requirement for rye percentage in Canada. Corn is usually the majority grain.

General Specifications:
Has to be aged a minimum of 3 years in its native country in wooden barrels no larger than 700 liters- new, old, charred or uncharred, it doesn’t matter.
The spirit has to be mashed and distilled in Canada.
When bottled it has to be at least 40% ABV.
Caramel coloring and artificial flavoring can be added.

## Basic Whiskey Terminology

Alcohol by volume (ABV): As the name suggests, this is the proportion of alcohol as a percentage of the total volume. A higher number means a stronger whisky.

Body: This is a hard term to explain, but it basically refers to the way a whisky feels in your mouth. A whisky that seems to flood your mouth with flavor has a lot of body.
Cask: The barrel in which the whisky was aged, usually made of oak. This is the source of much of the distinctive woody flavor of whisky.

Complex: Having many layers and elements. A more complex whisky is one that you can taste and discuss for hours. A more complex whisky is not always the best, although it
Dram: A serving of whisky (the exact amount can vary).

Finish: The moments after you have swallowed a whisky; also, the flavors and experiences you encounter during this time.

Legs: The way a whisky acts when swirled in a glass. A more viscous whisky will stick to the side of the glass, giving it ‘legs’ while a thinner whisky will not.

Malt: A process in which starch is converted to sugar. Malts have a distinctive taste that is appreciated by fine palates. Grain that is soaked in water and then dried begins to malt, adding a new flavor to the whisky it graces.

Mouth feel: This means exactly as it sounds: the way a whisky feels in your mouth. This is usually due to viscosity and other physical factors, although the flavors can definitely have an effect on the way a mouth feel is perceived.

Palate: This can refer to one of two things: the time in which a whisky is in your mouth, or the individual flavors present in the drink.
Peat: The fuel over which malted barley is dried. This gives Scotch whisky its distinctive flavor and smokiness.

Proof: Twice the ABV. This is an old English way of ranking the alcohol content, but all you have to remember is that it is exactly two times the ABV, so an 80 proof whisky is 40% ABV.

Viscous: Having a slightly thicker, stickier mouth feel. A viscous whisky will also have more defined legs when it is swirled slightly in the glass.

## Describing Bourbon Whiskey

Dignified vs. Youthful. This distinction is difficult to describe, but it is easy to tell the difference. A youthful whisky tends to be vibrant, light, but not altogether integrated. A dignified whisky has an irresistible and seamless blend of flavors that are clear and easy to distinguish.

Soft vs. Firm. Again, this can be difficult to explain in words, but you will be able to tell the difference.

Dry vs. Sweet. A dry whisky can actually make your mouth feel dry. It is astringent without any sweetness. A sweet whisky, on the other hand, has a sweet taste and a very wet feeling.

Big vs. Subtle. A ‘big’ whisky dominates your mouth. The tastes and flavors are impossible to miss. On the other hand, a  subtle whisky has an I-can’t-put-my-finger-on-it quality.

Austere vs. Rich. An austere whisky is simple and straightforward, a what you see is what you get kind of drink. A rich whisky, on the other hand, will have multiple layers and a complex presence. Rich whiskies often have thicker mouth feels as well, but this is not always the case.

Balanced: This means that the flavors blend well, with none of them overwhelming the mix. Balance is usually a positive aspect in a whisky.

Estery: Chemically, an ester is a compound that has a fruity, flowery taste and smell.
Ethanolic or Spirity: Ethanol is the alcohol in whisky. A heavy alcoholic taste or smell can be called either of these terms.

Phenolic: To go back to chemistry, a phenol is a compound that has a tarry, thick, heavy aspect. This term describes a taste or scent that is tarry and heavy.

Warm or hot. Some whiskies will actually make your mouth feel warmer, as though the liquid were warmed before you drank it. These terms are great for describing this phenomenon.
