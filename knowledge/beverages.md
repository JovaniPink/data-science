## Intro to Alcoholic Beverages

Fermented Beverages

All alcoholic beverages begin with the process of fermentation. Fermentation is the action of yeast on sugar that produces two by-products: alcohol and carbon dioxide. Basically, any liquid containing sugar can become an alcoholic beverage by the addition of yeast. Beer and wine are fermented beverages. Beer is produced by the fermentation of grains. Wine is produced by the fermentation of grapes or other fruits.

In addition to beer and wine, other common fermented beverages include cider (called hard cider in the U.S.), malt beverages (usually referring to clear malt-based beverages with fruity or other "fun" flavors that appeal to younger drinkers), mead, sake (commonly served in Asia and places that serve Asian food), and vermouth (a type of wine used in many cocktails).

Separating the alcohol from the liquid it was fermented in produces distilled spirits. This is done by heating the liquid until the alcohol evaporates into a gas, trapping the gas away from the fermented liquid and then cooling it until the gas condenses into liquid form. This liquid is the 'spirit'.

Common spirits include absinthe, brandy, gin, rum, tequila, vodka, and a variety of whiskies. Less common and regional spirits are available, too. Liqueurs are sweetened alcohols with flavors like chocolate, coffee, melons, oranges, other fruit and berries. Nuts and herbs are other popular flavors.

The differences in the flavor and aromas of distilled beverages can be attributed to the substances that evaporated with the alcohol from the original fermented liquid when it was distilled. These other substances are called congeners. These substances, combined with various processes after the spirit has been distilled, account for the distinctive flavors and aromas of the different distilled spirits.

Whiskeys(Whisky)
Whiskeys are made by distilling a fermented mash of grain. In order to start the fermentation in grain you must add malt to the mixture. Malt is a sprouted grain, which contains an enzyme that converts the starch in the grain to sugar. The most commonly used malt is barley. After the starches are converted to sugar the fermentation can begin. Scotch Whiskeys are whiskeys that are made in Scotland.

There are two different types: Single Malt Scotches are pure malt Whiskey. They are most commonly made from sprouted barley that has been dried over peat fires. This gives the beverage its characteristic smoky flavor. Blended Scotches are made from both malt whiskey and grain whiskey: The grain whiskey is usually made from corn and is very light in flavor.

Irish Whiskeys differ from Scotch Whiskeys in that the Irish do not dry their barley over peat fires and they often use grains other than barley. Irish Whiskeys are also triple distilled, which makes them very smooth and in general lighter-bodied than Scotch Whiskeys.

Bourbon Whiskey is an American unblended Whiskey, which gets its name from its place of origin, Bourbon County, Kentucky. It is made from at least 51% corn and is aged for at least 2 years in charred oak barrels. Most Bourbons use a sour mash yeasting process. Along with fresh yeast, a little bit of the leftovers from a previous distilling is added to the mash.

• Single Barrel Bourbons come from small, hand-made batches
of Whiskey that are made from the finest ingredients, using traditional methods. Some may be bottled without any water at a very high proof; others may contain water from a
particular stream or well.

• Rye Whiskeys are made in the same way that Bourbon Whiskeys are, except that the mash must be at least 51% Rye.

• Tennessee Whiskeys are made with the same sour yeast process and grain requirements as Bourbon Whiskey, but before being barreled for aging the distillate is filtered through maple charcoal.

• Blended Whiskeys are made from a combination of Whiskey with neutral spirits. The blend cannot contain more than 20% straight Whiskey.

• Canadian Whiskeys are blended whiskeys that are light bodied and delicate in flavor. They are distilled from corn, rye, barley malt, and wheat. Each brand has its own recipe and a distinctive flavor. Most are aged at least 6 years.

Asian Whiskys are a growing trend in the Whisky business with Japanese whisky being named top Whisky in 2015 and ten in the top 10 ranked spirits, even over the Scottish and Irish competitors. Highly crafted, often importing grain from European and Western sources. Aged in a variety of barrels based on producer-oak, white oak, sherry casks, etc. Japanese water used to make this is often much softer and has less minerality which gives a smoothness to the drink.

Distilled Spirits

BRANDIES

Brandies are distilled from wine grapes. Caramel is added for color. While there are some excellent domestic brands, the most famous brandies are named for their growing regions- Cognac and Armagnac.

• Vodka is distilled from grain or potatoes. It
is not aged and is filtered through charcoal to absorb the congeners. It is mostly tasteless and colorless, making it a popular ingredient in cocktail recipes. Gin is a spirit that has the flavor of juniper berries. It is made from neutral spirits that
are re- distilled with juniper berries and other botanicals. Each brand has a very distinctive flavor and a closely guarded recipe. A guest that enjoys one gin may not necessarily enjoy another. Gin is not aged.

Cognac is a region in France that makes the most famous and prestigious brandies in the world. They are made primarily from the white grapes folle blanche and ungi blanc, and are distilled under strict government regulation in alembic copper stills. Cognacs are aged at least 1.5 years in special oak barrels. Most are aged at least 2 4 years. Cognacs are blends of brandies made in several vintages so there is no date on the label. Instead, there is a system of symbols
that describe the relative age and quality:

• V = very S = superior
O = old P = pale E = extra X = extra

• VS means that the cognac has been aged for at least 1.5 years.

• VSOP means that the cognac has been aged in wood at least 4.5 years, and most likely 7- 10 years.

• Extra, Vielle Reserve, and Napoleon may not appear on the label unless the cognac is at least 5.5 years old.

• Grand Champagne is the name of the heart of the Cognac region-it
signifies that the brandy was made with only grapes from this area.

• Rum is made all over the Caribbean basin.

How they are made and what they are distilled from depends on where they are made. Puerto Rican Rum/Cuban is distilled from fermented molasses. They are light-flavored and light-bodied. Those labeled white or silver has been aged for at least one year. Amber and gold have had caramel added for flavor and color and are aged at least 3 years. Red label and heavy dark have been aged for at least 6 years and are more full bodied and mellow.

• Fine Champagne means that 50% of the grapes come from Grand
Champagne and the rest of Petite Champagne- the area next-door to and outside of Grand Champagne.

• Armagnac is a French brandy from the region of Armagnac. It has the same label coding system as Cognac, except that it is allowed to name a vintage on the bottle if all of the brandy inside comes from that year. The brandies of Armagnac tend to be slightly more wild and rustic in style because they are not used to commercially exploit as those of Cognac. They tend to be a better example of the old school style. Eau de Vie is brandy made from fruits; both imported and domestic ones are
given this name.

• Calvados is a fine apple brandy made in Normandy. It is oak- aged, giving it a deep straw color.

Liqueurs & Cordials, Aperitifs, Sherry
Liqueurs and Cordials are essentially the same thing: distilled spirits that are steeped in or re distilled with various fruits, flowers, plants and their juices or extracts, or other natural flavoring materials and then sweetened. Alcohol and sugar levels can vary greatly. Aperitifs are beverages meant to be consumed before dinner and usually have properties that are designed to 'prepare' and 'wheť' the palate for future consumption. Vermouth consumed as an aperitif; traditionally they are seasoned blends and fortification of wines. Each brand has its own secret recipe.

• Digestifs are traditionally lumped into the liqueur category because they are sweet. They are herbal; they have medicinal properties that aid in comfort and digestion after a large meal. They are basically distillates that have been flavored with various additives to give them their herbal sweet flavors and aromas.

Sherry is a fortified wine product of Spain, specifically from the Jerez region in the southern province Andalucia. Sherry is made entirely from white wine grapes. The deep color that some sherries achieve develops from oxidation. There are three main types of sherries:

• Dry White - Styles called Finos and Manzanillas served chilled; aperitif or with food

• Dry Brown - Styles called Dry Oloroso or Amontillado are served at room temperature; aperitif or with food

• Sweet Brown - Styles called Cream or Rich Oloroso served at room temperature, after dinner or with dessert \* Vintages are not given for Sherries because they use a fractional system of blending called a Solera system. This is a system of blending wine from several vintages in order to smooth out the difference between vintages and maintain a consistency in a certain style. Some Soleras were started decades ago. Any bottling from a particular Solera will contain some wine from the oldest vintage.

Ports

Port is a sweet fortified wine most often served after a meal. Grape alcohol is added to the wine partway through fermentation, a stopping the process at a point where the wine has plenty of sweetness and alcohol (18 to 20 percent). Port wines originated in the Douro Valley in northern Portugal; the best ports still come from that area. The name is derived from the fact that these wines are shipped out of the Portuguese city of Oporto and, in fact, such wines are labeled “Porto," rather than “port. There are many types of port and the various labels can be confusing.

• Port is made and sold in several different styles:
• Vintage Ports are the best and often the most expensive. They are made from grapes of a single vintage, bottled within 2 years. The very best of these can age 50 years or more. These ports must be decanted.
• Late-bottled Vintage Ports or LBV Ports are also made from grapes of a single vintage (though the grapes are not of as high a quality as those for vintage Ports). Late-bottled Vintage Ports are aged in wood for up to 6 years, while Single Vintage Ports have been wood-aged at least 7 years. Both are ready to drink when bottled and do not have the aging potential of Vintage Ports.
• Aged Tawny Ports are a blend of grapes from several different years and can be aged in wood for as long as 40 years. They're tawny in color and ready to drink when bottled. The age on the bottle is an average age.
• Colheita Ports or Single Vintage Tawny Ports, are also made from the grapes of a single vintage, but are aged for a minimum of 7 years in oak casks to develop the caramel-like qualities of a tawny port. The extended cask aging oxidizes these wines, resulting in a pale russet color. The words "Matured in Cask” or “Aged in Wood" are required, and are often the only way to distinguish these from the more prestigious Vintage Ports.

Of course, some people prefer non-alcoholic beverages, and most mixed drinks can be made without alcohol (so called "virgin" drinks) or in our case the Mocktails. Most bars offer drink staples like sodas, juices, coffee, and larger bars like ours may offer iced or hot tea and bottled water.

Mixers are an important part of most mixed drinks, whether alcoholic or not. As mentioned, caffeinated beverages like coffee, tea, and juices are sometimes added to drinks to counteract the suppressant effect of alcohol and create the cocktail also known as the complex cocktail.

Complex Cocktail:
A quality complex cocktail contains at least three structural elements of a spirit, sugar, acidity (sour), bitters, herbals, smoky, saline, water.

Then once the cocktail’s elements are selected we move unto the BUILD process, BALANCE, SERVE (Glassware) and then GARNISH.

Keep an open mind and always encourage people to keep exploring flavor combinations. The combinations do need to balance to guest don’t come back with potentially negative comments of the drink being too sweet, too sour, too strong, or too watery.

A rocks pour has about 1.5 to 2 ounces of spirit served either neat or on the rocks.

A cocktail glass or “martini glass” has a total of 3 ounces and served up.

A great highball has a ratio of 1.25 to 2 ounces of spirit to 4.0 to 5.5 ounces of juice/mixer. The highball is a single ingredient plus a core spirit or liqueur.

A collins glass is a glass tumbler which typically will contain 300 to 410 millilitres (10 to 14 US fl oz). It is used to serve mixed drinks, especially Tom Collins or John Collins cocktails. It is cylindrical in shape and narrower and taller than a highball glass… so collins for complex cocktails.

Syrups, like simple syrup, add sweetness, and some, like grenadine, also add pleasant color to the drinks. Other syrups, like sour mix and sweetened lime juice add both a sweet and a sour taste to drinks. Bitters impart a bitter taste to drinks. Bitters are an important flavor in many cocktails, and are a required ingredient in true cocktails according to purists.

Other mixers include a variety of carbonated mixers (including carbonated and tonic waters, and also citrus, cola, ginger, or sarsaparilla flavored sodas), juices (including tomato and vegetable juices, tropical-flavored juices, and other fruit and berry juices), dairy products (like milk, half and half, heavy cream, or ice cream), and even hot or savory sauces.

Ice is an important part of many drinks, whether blended or on the rocks.

The final ingredient is the garnish. Many drinks include inedible garnishes like straws or little paper umbrellas or plastic animals. Other garnishes, like citrus peel twists, are not really edible, but the same fruit can be quartered or sliced, and then it becomes an edible part of the drink experience. Other edible garnishes include tropical fruits like pineapple and coconut, cherries, and vegetables like carrot or celery sticks, green olives, or cocktail onions. Even spices and seasonings like cinnamon, cocoa powder, mint sprigs and leaves, salt, and sugar can be used to enhance a drink.

All of these ingredients are served to the customer in some type of drinkware.
