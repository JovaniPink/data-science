# Cordials & Liqueurs

Hiram Walker Triple Sec: Triple sec is a colorless, orange-flavored liqueur used in thousands of mixed drinks and recipes as a sweetening and flavoring agent. The orange flavor comes from the dried peels of prematurely-picked oranges that grow natively on the island of Curacao, and tend to be bitterer than other oranges. The peels then macerate in alcohol to disperse the flavor.

Disaronno Amaretto: Amaretto is an Italian sweet, almond-flavored liqueur. It is made from a base of apricots or almond pits, sometimes both.

St. Germain: St. Germain is the first liqueur in the world created in the artisanal French manner from freshly handpicked elderflower blossoms.

Chambord: France- "The overripe aroma is concentrated, viny/seed-like and intensely raspberry jam-like in both stages. Tastes of cassis, red raspberry syrup or, better, raspberry compote. Long, ripe, intense berry aftertaste."

Southern Comfort: USA- Originating from the French Quarter or New Orleans, Southern Comfort is a fruit, spice and whiskey flavored liqueur blended with whiskey, orange, vanilla, sugar and cinnamon.

Baileyâ€™s: Ireland- Weaves together Irish whiskey, cream and fine spirits to create a perfect blend of flavors. Enjoy on its own or in a variety of refreshing beverages both hot and cold. Enjoy over ice to release the hidden flavors of this classic.

Romana Sambuca: Italy- The famous anise-flavored liqueur, produced by the infusion of witch elder bush and licorice, sweetened with sugar and enhanced with a secret combination of herbs and spices.

Grand Marnier: France- Created in 1880 by Louis-Alexandre Marnier Lapostolle. A delicate blend of fine cognacs and distilled essence of tropical oranges, aged in French oak casks for roundness and subtlety. Long finish of bitter orange, orange marmalade and hazelnut. Use in margaritas or martinis.

Kahlua: Mexico- A round, syrupy entry leads to sweet medium body of mild roasted coffee, simple syrup, and milk chocolate flavors. Finishes with a mild, creamy mocha and honey fade. A pleasant and very mixable coffee liqueur.

Midori: USA- Set apart by its brilliant green color, this melon liqueur was the first of its kind. Light and fresh, with a great honeydew melon flavor that makes it perfect on its own or in any number of fruit-flavored cocktails. Serve over ice for a refreshing after-dinner treat.

Frangelico: Italy- A hazelnut and herb flavored liqueur. Nuts are crumbled up and combined with cocoa, vanilla berries, and other natural flavors, and then left to soak in the base spirit. After the spirit has absorbed the flavor of the ingredients, the liqueur is filtered, sweetened, and bottled.
