## Beer

Beers are fermented beverages made from malted grain, water, yeast and hops. Hops are resinous flowers that stabilize beer for long-term storage and add a distinctive, quenching bitterness to beer. The two primary beer categories are ales and lagers, each of which is a family of brewing yeasts.

Ale yeasts are the more ancient of the two. Ale fermentations are hot and fast, extracting rich, fruity flavors from the grain. The traditional beers of the UK and Belgium are ales, and the vast majority of American micro-brews imitate these ale styles. Popular styles include Pale Ales, IPA’s, Brown Ales, Porters, Stouts, Doubles, Triples and all wheat beers.

Lager yeasts are much more recent additions to the beer family, first discovered in Eastern Europe and Germany. These cold climate yeasts ferment much more slowly and at far colder temperatures, yielding crisper, cleaner flavors than traditional ales. Almost all German beers and almost all of the world’s large-scale commercial brands, from Budweiser to Corona are lagers. Popular styles include Pilsners, Octoberfests, Bock beers and Kolsch. About Beer

## How Beer is Made

Beer is made from malted grains (usually barley), water, hops and yeast. Some beer styles call for wheat to mixed with the barley. Some of the huge breweries even use corn and/or rice mixed with the barley because of the monetary savings derived from buying those cheaper grains and shorter ‘cook’ times.

The malted barley is steeped in very hot water (just below boiling) for up to several hours- very much like a cup of tea. This liquid is called the “wort”. The cooking of the malted barley extracts its flavors and converts its starches into fermentable sugars, thus the wort is very sweet. The wort is then separated from the barley grains and put into the boiling kettle. The wort is boiled from 1 hour to several hours. During the boil, flavoring hops are added to impart some bitterness to balance the sweetness of this barley infused water. Near the end of the boil, more hops are usually added. These later hops create the “nose” or flowery aroma in the beer.

The wort is then drained away from the hops, and chilled VERY quickly and placed into a fermentation tank. Yeast is then “pitched” into the wort. There are two basic styles of yeast: 1) lager or “bottom fermenting” yeast and 2) Ale or “top fermenting” yeast. The yeast begins to convert the sugars into alcohol immediately (usually begins within an hour).

After this conversion, some style of beers call for more hops to be added to impart a more bitter “bite” to the beer. This is called “dry hopping”.

After proper “aging” or “lagering” in the “airing” or “bright” tanks, the liquid can be “primed” for bottling or kegging. The liquid is primed by adding more fermentable sugar (usually fresh wort) that will produce the alcohol and carbon dioxide (carbonation) evident in the beer.

Most beer should be enjoyed within 3 months of bottling, less they begin to lose their flavor and freshness. Some beers require extensive aging to bring out its complexity (e.g. Thomas Hardy Ale). While others are ready to drink immediately, yet can still improve with age (e.g. Chimay Grande Reserve).

## Beer Ingredients

Malted Barley (a.k.a. Malt) Gives the beer its mouth feel and sweetness. Malt is barley seed that has been sprouted and dried. It is then roasted to varying degrees of darkness. Ranges from very pale (pilsners) to dark, espresso-like brown (stouts). The lighter malts have a more delicate flavor, medium roasts may be bread-like or biscuit-like, and dark roasted malt may offer coffee and chocolate flavors. Most beers are made with a combination of malts.

Hops This member of the cannabis family gives the beer its floral nose and bitterness. There is some debate as to whether Belgium or Germany began using hops in beer on a regular basis. It certainly began in the 1080’s to the early 1100’s. Bitterness of a beer is measured in Bitterness Units (BU’s). This is determined by the Alpha Acid content of that year’s crop of hops and the amount of hops added to a batch of beer. There are many varieties of hops: Willamette, Cascade, Saaz, East Kent Goldings, etc. Many beers use one type of hop, while others may use one hop for bittering and a different hop for aroma. And yet others may use many different hops in a single brew.
Yeast Converts fermentable sugar into alcohol and produces the carbonation in a naturally fermented brew. Has a tremendous effect on the flavor of beer. Yeast can impart sourness, fruitiness or other flavors. Every brewery has at least one “house strain” that they protect and propagate (except for lambics).

Water The mineral content of the local water gave the old breweries specific qualities. Soft water in Pilsen gave Pilsners a nice, soft character. Whereas the hard water in Burton on Trent gave English Pale Ales a more aggressive character. Many of today’s brewers treat the water to achieve the optimum properties for the beer style.

Other Ingredients Wheat is the most common adjunct added (some beers have 60% or more malted and/or unmalted wheat). Fruit is added to many Belgian Lambics. Oat flakes to Oatmeal Stout. Spices (ginger, coriander, orange peel, etc) have been added for centuries. The big beer factories (Bud, Coors) use corn and rice as cheap substitutes for malted barley.

Serving Temperature Most massed produced beers are served ice cold for a reason-they have no discernible flavor and the cold helps to mask that fact. Many European beers are served at Cellar Temperature (50-55). Most full flavored ales & dark lagers are best served no colder than this. The super rich Trappist Doubles can be enjoyed from 55-65. Light lagers should be served around 45.

## Beer Styles and Characteristics

Lagers Light Lagers/Pilsner/Bock/Doublebock/Dark Lager/Helles/Export/Dunkel/Amber Lager

Ales Trappist Double and Triple/Pale Ale/India Pale Ale/English Mild/Wee Heavy/Scotch Ale/Wheat/Saison/Porter/Stout/Brown Ale/Barley Wine/Golden Ale/Abbey Ales

Appearance Beer color ranges from the following-pale yellow, golden, copper, amber, red, brown, chocolate, black. The temperature and length of time the grain is roasted, and the amount of grain used, determines the color of the beer. Flavor and mouth feel can vary tremendously with beers of the same color.

Look at the head and the size of the bubbles. Small, tight bubbles indicate natural carbonation.

Whereas large bubbles often indicate artificial injection of carbon dioxide.

Aroma You may smell the floral aroma from the hops, the sweetness and maltedness from the grains, or both. You may also detect smells from improper brewing techniques and product mishandling. Oxidation will smell like cardboard or metal. A skunky smell indicates the beer has been exposed to light, heat or cold.

Taste Beer that is well balanced will give equal billing to all areas of the tongue. Food will affect the taste of beer. A second or third sip is often necessary for the true flavors of the beer to shine through.

Mouthfeel Feel the beer swirl over your tongue and around your mouth. A pislner will be very light and crisp and a barleywine and a Trappist Double will be full and tongue coating.

Finish Look for how long the flavor sensations last on your tongue. What is the last flavor that comes through?
