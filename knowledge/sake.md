The Basics of Sake
Sake Overview What is Sake?
Is it a wine, beer, an eau de vie?
• Wine - alcohol made from fermentation of natural sugars found in whatever fruit is chosen for the base flavor.
• Beer - alcohol made from fermenting sugars that are produced from malting grains. Eau de vie-already fermented alcohol that is concentrated during the distillation process, from vodka to grappa. Sake- is most like beer. The reason being beer, like sake, has to convert complex carbohydrates to sugars and then alcohol.
Common Perceptions and Misconceptions
Sake is a hard liquor(FALSE)- sake has the highest naturally occurring alcohol due to its unique fermentation process. It is not a hard liquor. Generally speaking sake has an average percentage of around 16% as high as
20% and as low as 8%. Only a little higher than a warm climate red wine. Sake glasses tend to be smaller than that of wine, hence a glass of sake and a glass of wine are about equal in alcohol.
Sake is cheap liquor likened to moonshine, best served hot.(FALSE) Most sake traditionally served in the United States has been mass produced domestically made from standard table rice. The process in which carbohydrates are converted to sugars is chemical, not natural. (all Morimoto sakes use a natural process). Substandard ingredients and production have led to the common perception that sake is no better than rubbing alcohol. A lack of balance and structure makes the alcohol in such sakes pronounced. There are many impurities or congeners in regular mass produced sakes, this is why so many people associate sake with bad hangovers. Premium sake that is served at Morimoto has very few congeners, no sulfites, no preservatives. As long as dehydration is avoided, bad hangovers from premium sake are few and far between. Mass produced sake is usually served hot for the simple reason that imperfection and lack of balance are disguised by the heat. Premium sake is served at a wide range of temperatures, most often slightly chilled

Production Key Ingredients
Water
Rice
Sake consists of 80% pure water. The mineral content of the water affects the taste of sake. Water most suitable for sake is found in what has become the renowned sake producing regions of Japan.
The better the water the better the sake. Water is used throughout the sake-making process. Starting with washing, then steaming, then as part of the mash and finally often added to dilute the sake after the brewing is complete. How hard (kousui) or soft (nansui) water is plays a role in the texture of the sake.
Sakamai or rice, is used in producing sake. It is quite different from the regular rice consumed for food. The grains of sakamai are much larger, thus making the growing process more difficult. Sakamai requires more water, nutrients and protection from harsh weather conditions. Regular table rice has fats, proteins and carbohydrates fairly well integrated throughout the grain.
In sakamai the outside of the grain is fat, protein and vitamins and the center is a white packet of starch (shinpaku). The closer to the center the purer the starch is. The genius of sakamai breeding is that the fermenting inhibitors: fats, proteins and vitamins lie on the outside of the grain and will be easily milled away prior to the brewing process, leaving the packet of starch (shinpaku) behind. Like grapes, there are many different breeds or varieties of sakamai. They have been bred over the centuries to best suit the local climate. There are hundreds of varieties and seldom to never will a customer in America or even Japan inquire as to what kind of sakamai is used in this sake. It is not uncommon to see blending of sakamai during the brewing process.
In general, water across Japan is relatively soft but there is variation across the country.
Water rich in iron and manganese are bad for sake. Iron discolors and speeds the aging process and manganese discolors sake when exposed to light.
o The Top Four:
• Yamadanishiki- fragrant, fruity - most commonly used sakamai
• Gohyakumangoku- clean, light- used mostly on Sea of Japan side
• Miyami Nishiki- richer grainy feel- northern rice, cold weather rice Omachi – light fragrance, earthy, oldest pure strain of sakamai, the yang to Yamadanishiki's ying

Key Ingredients (continued)
Mold (Koji)
Koji is the powerful aspergillus oryzae mold that is inoculated onto steamed rice. o When propagated on rice, koji creates an enzyme that breaks up the long chains of starch molecules, which ordinarily yeast alone cannot. These shorter chains become simple sugars and are ready for conversion into alcohol with the aid of some yeast. o There are two methods of koji production: one traditional, very labor intensive and done by hand, the other done mechanically. o The key to making koji is that the mold should grow evenly throughout the grain and that the grains do not clump together inhibiting the continuity of koji on the individual grain. Both of these methods are used in producing premium sake Yeast (Kobo)
With any alcohol conversion in brewing or wine making yeast must be introduced to convert sugars into alcohol. o Traditionally, naturally occurring yeasts were added to the sake mash to create alcohol using two methods known as kimoto and yamahai. These methods are still used on a small scale today, they usually produce a sake that has a good acidity, a pleasant sweetness and a somewhat gamey, or earthy quality. For about the last hundred years most yeast has been cultivated in labs.

These yeasts are specifically created for sake production that suit local climate, sakamai and desired flavor profile. Many new strains of yeast are created every year. Some stand the test of time while others fade away.

    The Basics of Sake (continued)
    Classifications of Sake Sakes are classified by the amount of milling/polishing that is done to the rice. These classifications, or seimaibuai, refer to the amount of the grain that is left after the polishing process. The polishing process is a determining factor in premium sakes because the outer part of each grain contains fats and proteins that create impurities in the final beverage. Therefore, we can be confident in telling our guests that the more of the grain that is polished away the higher the quality (and price) of sake.
    Classifications o Junmai-"pure sake”
    Minimum polishing of 30% Contains only water, rice, yeast and koji; absolutely no brewer's alcohol added.

Junmai shu are usually a bit heavier and fuller in rice flavor than other types of sake, and often the acidity is higher.
Honjozo

Minimum polishing of 30%
Not all of the alcohol in this sake is made during the fermentation process. Some distilled brewers alcohol is added to lighten the sake, and excite esters to attain a
certain flavor profile. Consider it the table wine of the premium sake world. Great table wine, like great Honjozo, is an amazing value and fun with food. Ginjo
Minimum polishing of 40% o Known for a fragrant nose and smooth light texture. o The word Ginjo on a label a reassuring word to a sake novice. If one reads Junmai Ginjo on the label it means the alcohol is made purely from rice during fermentation. If the label reads only Ginjo it means that a slight amount of distilled brewer's alcohol was added to attain the desired profile of the master brewer. The same holds true for Daiginjo. Very difficult to differentiate between the two doing blind tastings.

The Basics of Sake (continued)
Classifications (continued) o Daiginjo
Minimum polishing of 50% The highest grade of sake. Dai means big-Ginjo we already know, so this is the big Ginjo. The more that is milled away the lighter, the smoother, the more refined the sake becomes. It also makes the inflections of yeast, water and tender
loving care are apparent.
_Remember if a label has "Junmai" in front of either "Ginjo" or "Daiginjo” that means that no distilled brewer's alcohol has been added. It is a "pure" version of that level of sake._  
Koshu- Aged Sake
Generally sake is meant to be consumed within the year it is released.

Koshu has been around for centuries but fell out of popularity about one hundred years ago because of taxation on breweries. It was only 50 years ago that such taxes were revised. During the 13th century this was the chosen drink of the royals because of its deep rich and complex flavors.

Aged in tanks in relatively warm condition the reaction between amino acids and sugars cause the color change in the sake and interesting flavor profiles.

Generally speaking most koshu is milled to only 70% remaining. Beyond 70% the sake does not have enough amino acids to make a good koshu. Three of Morimoto's sakes are koshu. This a unique and exciting feature to the Morimoto dining experience and something will surely impress your customer.

Prefectural Variations
Akita- sake in the north of Japan tend to be tight, compact, and clean. Akita sakes typify this style. Iwate- generally slightly sweet, clean, slightly layered, good umami styles do very throughout the prefecture. Miyagi - sakes are a slightly more open, gently sweet, and low acidity very easy drinking.

Fukushima - soft billowing, great water, varied styles, Niigata - the most famous region in Japan, mountainous, great water, some of the best rice in Japan, the sakes here are dry, clean with a short finish. This style in Japanese is called "kire”, meaning both beautiful and clean. Ibaraki –not particularly famous or sought after in Japan because of its urban image, the brewers in this prefecture are very creative and innovative.

Nagano- soft, light, and aromatic, a very easy drinking style, also set in the Japanese Alps, mountains provide great water. Ishikawa- located in the center of Japan along the Sea of Japan. These sakes are full, complex, dense, while have a subtle quality, the water is usually harder than the rest of Japan. 80% of the sake is consumed within the prefecture.
Yamanashi- only fourteen breweries in this prefecture, more wineries here than sake breweries. Situated in the Southern Alps sakes here are similar in style to Nagano, soft, aromatic a little fuller bodied. Hyogo- Kobe city situated in Hyogo prefecture produces more sake than any other prefecture in Japan. Dry sturdy and usually not so aromatic, these sakes are referred to as "masculine sake". Kyoto- second only to Hyogo in sake production, soft water, slightly sweet, aromatic and elegant, there are no Kyoto sakes on the Morimoto list.

Tottori- soft, sometimes a little salty, classic, nice umami, sturdy style of sake. Shimane- nutty, perfect acidity, slightly sweet aromas, often with pumpkin-like notes Okayama- sweet and full Yamaguchi-only 20 breweries in this prefecture, light but no distinct style from this region

Ehime- situated on Shikoku island, sakes have a light, layered, comp pleasant acidity

  Shochu vs Soju
  • In essence both Shochu and Soju are related. The main differences are in production, one can say shochu is more pure, focusing on main ingredients and craftsmanship. Shochu is best enjoyed on its own although it is not uncommon to mix it with fruit juice or oolong tea and it is often enjoyed on the rocks with citrus peel (Chef Morimoto style). On the other hand Soju can have additives such as sugar and it can be seen more like a 'mixer' in cocktails. Another important factor is the ABV(Alcohol by Volume), where in Soju it can be lower.
  • Shōchū ( ?) Japanese sake is made from rice, just as wine is made from grapes. But shochu (Otsu type shochu) can be made from a variety of raw materials. Each material imparts a different unique flavor and aroma profile to the final product. The high-quality ingredients have to be selected carefully and are usually produced in the same region where the shochu is made.
  Key regions and styles to know:
  • Kagoshima - Believed to be the birthplace of Japanese Shochu. All shochu in this region is Imo(Sweet Potato). The profile is richer, masculine with an accentuated earthy tone.
  • Kumamoto and Miyazaki – These areas focus on Kome(rice) shochu production. Note the rice in Kome Shochu is Japonica short grain Rice. Profile is clean with citrus tones Saga, Fukuoka and Oita - These areas favor Mugi(Barley) Shochu. Barley creates a layered, complex and serious style of Shochu. Aromas are rich with occasional coffee and cereal notes. Okinawa - Makes an interesting style of Shochu named Awamori, that is produced from a strain of Thai rice. Because of the weather in Okinawa and often aged process, this Shochu exhibits a deep, powerful oxidative aroma with stone fruits and an underlining tannic structure. Oita and Miyasaki - Produce Soba(Buckwheat) Shochu characterized by a 'grainy' profile with depth and often milk chocolate and caramel tones.
  • Amami Oshima - Excels in Kokuto(Brown Sugar) Shochu Production. The aroma and taste is clean and of course slightly caramelized.

  Shochu vs Soju (continued)
  • Soju was first distilled around the 13th century, during the Mongol invasions of Korea. The Mongols had acquired the technique of distilling Arak from the Persiansel during their invasion of Central Asia and the Middle East around 1256. It was subsequently introduced to the Koreans, and distilleries were set up around the city of Kaesong. In the surrounding areas of Kaesong, soju is known as arak-ju (hangul: OFF South Korea
  From 1965 until 1999, in order to alleviate rice shortages. the South Korean government prohibited the traditional distillation of soju from rice. Instead, highly distilled ethanolfrom sweet potatoes and tapioca was mixed with water, flavoring, and sweetener to create soju. Although the prohibition has been lifted, cheap soju continues to be made this way. The South Korean government regulates the alcohol content of diluted soju to less than 35%,but alcohol levels have continued to fall in order to reduce production costs The lower alcohol concentration also makes the drink milder to consume, which may broaden its appeal.
  Several regions have resumed distilling soju from grain. Soju from Andong, South Korea is a traditional hand-crafted soju that has about 45% ABV. Hwayo (272) is another brand with five different mixes constituting an ABV range from 17% to 53%. Here is a quote from Korea Tour Information website :“Soju is a popular local spirit that has comforted people's hearts for many years. No matter whether people feel happy or sad, it has remained Koreans' best friend for a long time. Some people would say they feel something is missing without soju when there is a bowl of hot, boiling kimchi stew on the table or a large plate of pork belly in front of them. Soju is something that many people cannot live without. There are many reasons that people drink soju. Some enjoy, getting drunk with close friends. Others drink soju to wash away their fatigue and stress. The liquor is also popular because it also
  goes well with many dishes.
  Soju accounts for nearly 40 percent of the total alcohol consumed by people in Korea each year, according to a recent study. Though Koreans drink more beer than soju in terms of absolute volume, soju remains the most popular liquor when comparing volume and alcohol percentage”
